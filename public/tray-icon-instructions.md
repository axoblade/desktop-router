# Tray Icon Instructions

For the best system tray experience, you need a 16x16 pixel icon. Here are a few options:

## Option 1: Convert existing icon

Use any image converter to resize the existing icon.svg to 16x16 pixels and save as tray-icon.png

## Option 2: Create a simple text-based icon

You can use a simple character or emoji as a tray icon temporarily.

## Option 3: Use online converters

- Go to https://convertio.co/svg-png/
- Upload the icon.svg file
- Set dimensions to 16x16
- Download as tray-icon.png

The tray icon should be placed in the public folder as tray-icon.png for optimal results.
